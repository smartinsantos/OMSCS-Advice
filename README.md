# Advice on Choosing OMSCS Classes

The OMSCS program doesn't currently enforce any prerequisites.  But folks often want to know which class they should take first.


**There are a lot of opinions out there, so let's share them here!**


Here's what you need to do:
1.  Clone this repo.
2.  Create a new folder to store your advice.
3.  Use Visio 2016 to change an existing Advice Chart into something that reflects your opinion.
4.  Add a README.md file that explains your Advice Chart.
5.  Submit a pull request so you chart can be added to this GitHub repo. 



**I would love to see advice on:*
1.  The classes to take if you love 
    * Python
    * Java
    * C 
    * etc.
2.  The classes to take to prepare for a career in:
    * Health Informatics
    * Data Science
    * Computer Security
    * etc.





These files were created using Microsoft Visio 2016.
